# SAM2

## Overview

SAM2 (Segment Anything Model 2) was proposed in [Segment Anything in Images and Videos](https://scontent-ssn1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/453323338_287900751050452_6064535069828837026_n.pdf?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=TnvI-AaGawoQ7kNvgEl0dlN&_nc_ht=scontent-ssn1-1.xx&gid=AX-dMq559vcArFkUSUxhQLn&oh=00_AYD10LO4L0BLTWS7vaKw_fnxjCb8G4q2cGjlCf1EDcfShQ&oe=66ADE939) by Nikhila Ravi, Valentin Gabeur, Yuan-Ting Hu, Ronghang Hu, Chaitanya Ryali, Tengyu Ma, Haitham Khedr, Roman Rädle, Chloe Rolland, Laura Gustafson, Eric Mintun, Junting Pan, Kalyan Vasudev Alwala, Nicolas Carion, Chao-Yuan Wu, Ross Girshick, Piotr Dollár, Christoph Feichtenhofer.

The model can be used to predict segmentation masks of any object of interest given an input image.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

*We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billion masks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive -- often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at [https://segment-anything.com](https://segment-anything.com) to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.*

Tips:

- The model predicts binary masks that states the presence or not of the object of interest given an image.
- The model predicts much better results if input 2D points and/or input bounding boxes are provided
- You can prompt multiple points for the same image, and predict a single mask. 
- Fine-tuning the model is not supported yet
- According to the paper, textual input should be also supported. However, at this time of writing this seems to be not supported according to [the official repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/issues/4#issuecomment-1497626844). 


This model was contributed by [sangbumchoi](https://github.com/SangbumChoi).
The original code can be found [here](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2/tree/main).

Below is an example on how to run mask generation given an image and a 2D point:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import Sam2Model, Sam2Processor

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = SamModel.from_pretrained("danelcsb/sam2.1_heira_tiny").to(device)
processor = SamProcessor.from_pretrained("danelcsb/sam2.1_heira_tiny")

img_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
raw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
input_points = [[[450, 600]]]  # 2D location of a window in the image

inputs = processor(raw_image, input_points=input_points, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

masks = processor.image_processor.post_process_masks(
    outputs.pred_masks.cpu(), inputs["original_sizes"].cpu(), inputs["reshaped_input_sizes"].cpu()
)
scores = outputs.iou_scores
```

You can also process your own masks alongside the input images in the processor to be passed to the model.

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import requests
from transformers import Sam2Model, Sam2Processor

device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
model = Sam2odel.from_pretrained("danelcsb/sam2.1_heira_tiny").to(device)
processor = Sam2Processor.from_pretrained("fdanelcsb/sam2.1_heira_tiny")

img_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
raw_image = Image.open(requests.get(img_url, stream=True).raw).convert("RGB")
mask_url = "https://huggingface.co/ybelkada/segment-anything/resolve/main/assets/car.png"
segmentation_map = Image.open(requests.get(mask_url, stream=True).raw).convert("1")
input_points = [[[450, 600]]]  # 2D location of a window in the image

inputs = processor(raw_image, input_points=input_points, segmentation_maps=segmentation_map, return_tensors="pt").to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs)

masks = processor.image_processor.post_process_masks(
    outputs.pred_masks.cpu(), inputs["original_sizes"].cpu(), inputs["reshaped_input_sizes"].cpu()
)
scores = outputs.iou_scores
```
